## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
{ "type": "GeometryCollection",
  "geometries": [
    { "type": "Point",
      "coordinates": [
        [-89.33,30]]
    }
```


**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for Python developers, researchers, or analysts who want to perform geospatial modeling and GIS analysis with Python. Basic knowledge of digital mapping and analysis using Python or other scripting languages will be helpful.	

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapters 1-11).


### Software and Hardware List

This book assumes you have basic knowledge of the Python programming language. You will require
the Anaconda 2.4.0 or higher with Python (3.10 or higher); a minimum hardware requirement of a
300-MHz processor, 128 MB of RAM, and 1.5 GB of available hard disk; and a Windows, Linux, or
macOS X operating system.

System requirements are mentioned in the following table:

| Software/Hardware                              | Operating System requirements      |
| ------------------------------------           | -----------------------------------|
| Anaconda 2.4.0 or higher                       | Windows – 64-bit x86; macOS – 64-bit x86 and M1; or Linux – 64-bit x86, 64-bit aarch64 (AWS Graviton2), 64-bit Power8/ Power9, or s390x (Linux on IBM Z and LinuxONE) |
| Python 3.10 or higher                          |8 GB of RAM|
| ECMAScript 11                                  |6 GB of disk space or more|

Follow the instructions for the latest Anaconda installation. All scripts in this book assume you will
run the code from the command line within an Anaconda Python environment. If you try to use
Jupyter Notebooks, you may get unpredictable results.
